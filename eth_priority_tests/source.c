/**
 * 
 * The source will inject data into the ethernet interface; we want to see what the latency (distribution)
 *      is when a jammer is running on the same network (through a TSN switch -- Hirschman BRS8TX).
 * The network traffic from the sink should be prioritized and sent through a VLAN to be given preference over the 
 *      generic traffic from the jammer
 * 
 * Assumed platform: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Intel Nuc (series 11), NIC i225
